Shortcuts in Python:


We have some variable x. And we assign to 5 as follows:

x = 5

Now we want to increment by 1.

One way to do this is by writing

`x = x + 1`

That would reassign x to 6.

But there is a shortcut for writing this because it is so common.


`x += 1`	<===>	'x = x + 1'


You can also do multiplication like this:

'x *= 5'	<===>	'x = x * 5'


For division:

'x /= 3'	<===>	'x = x / 3'
